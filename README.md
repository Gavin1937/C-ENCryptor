# C-ENCryptor

a cross-platform re-implementation of the core library from [MacPaw/ENCryptor](https://github.com/MacPaw/ENCryptor) encrypting/decrypting software.

The original repository is written in Objective-C and only for MAC OS, I decide to translate/rewrite it with C so I can port it to other platforms.
