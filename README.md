# C-ENCryptor

a cross-platform re-implementation of the core library from [MacPaw/ENCryptor](https://github.com/MacPaw/ENCryptor) encrypting/decrypting software.

The original repository is written in Objective-C and only for MacOS, I decide to re-implement it with C so I can port it to other platforms.


## Cross Platform

One goal of writing this library is to encrypt/decrypt ENCryptor archives cross-platform.

Right now I've tested this library against both Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04, & Ubuntu 20.04 (with OpenSSL 1.1.1f).
